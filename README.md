Task Manager
Task Manager is a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js, designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. It features task creation, reminders with audio notifications, weather integration for outdoor tasks, and a customizable user interface with light/dark mode support. The app leverages TypeScript for type safety, Redux for state management, and a robust ESLint configuration for code quality.

Features
Task Management:
Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
Filter tasks by categories like "Today," "Upcoming," and "Important."
Search tasks by title, location, or reminder time.
Reminders:
Set reminders with audio alerts and browser notifications.
Automatically dismiss reminders when tasks are completed or expired.
Weather Integration:
Display real-time weather for outdoor tasks based on location (fetched from a weather API).
Visual weather icons for quick reference (e.g., ‚òÄÔ∏è for clear, üåßÔ∏è for rain).
User Interface:
Responsive design with a collapsible sidebar for mobile and desktop.
Light and dark mode toggle using next-themes.
Progress tracking with a circular completion chart.
User Experience:
Avatar generation using DiceBear Avatars for personalized user profiles.
Smooth transitions and hover effects with Tailwind CSS.
Development Tools:
TypeScript for static typing and improved developer experience.
ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript rules for code consistency.
Prettier integration for automatic code formatting.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
npm (v9.x or later, comes with Node.js)
A code editor like VS Code
(Optional) Git for cloning the repository
Setup Project Environment
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
Replace https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git with your actual repository URL.

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required npm packages:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm install
This will install Next.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and other dependencies listed in package.json.

3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root directory to store environment variables. For example:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY: Required for weather data (get one from OpenWeatherMap).
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: Base URL for the app (optional, adjust for production).
4. Run the Development Server
Start the Next.js development server:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

5. Build for Production
To create an optimized production build:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm run build
Then start the production server:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm start
6. Lint and Format Code (Optional)
Run ESLint to check for linting issues:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm run lint
Fix linting issues automatically (if configured):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm run lint -- --fix
Ensure Prettier is set up (if not, install it with npm install --save-dev prettier and configure it).
7. Additional Setup Notes
Audio Files: Ensure the /public/sounds/alert.mp3 file exists for reminders. Add it to the public/sounds directory if missing.
Redux Store: Verify that src/redux/store.ts and related action files (src/redux/actions.ts) are correctly set up.
Type Definitions: Check src/types/task.ts for the Task interface used in TaskList.tsx.
